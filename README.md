# Full Option Photoshop Application

Welcome to the Computer Vision Photoshop-like Application! This project provides a set of computer vision functionalities inspired by Photoshop. With this application, you can manipulate images by adding noise, applying filters, segmenting images, detecting corners, applying thresholding and normalization, utilizing SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform), merging two images, and applying active contour to enhance your images.

## Features

- **Noise Addition:**
  - Add various types of noise to the image to simulate real-world scenarios.

- **Filter Application:**
  - Apply a range of filters to enhance or modify the image, such as blur, sharpen, or edge detection.

- **Image Segmentation:**
  - Segment the image to distinguish different regions or objects.

- **Corner Detection:**
  - Identify and mark corners in the image.

- **Thresholding and Normalization:**
  - Adjust pixel values through thresholding and normalization for better image quality.

- **SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform):**
  - Apply SIFT to detect and describe distinctive local features in the image.

- **Image Merging:**
  - Combine two images to create a composite image.

- **Active Contour Application:**
  - Utilize active contour models to detect and highlight object boundaries.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sherif-2001/computer-vision-photoshop.git
   ```

2. Install Dependencies:
- Ensure you have the required dependencies installed, such as OpenCV, NumPy, and Matplotlib.

3. Run the Application:
- Navigate to the project directory.
- Execute the main application script:
  ```bash
  python main.py
  ```
4. Follow On-screen Instructions:
- Use the graphical interface to select and apply the desired computer vision functionalities to your images.
